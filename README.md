Unit 2 Project 2 – Create a PHP Quiz App 12/17/18

Project Instructions
To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question on Slack or in the Treehouse Community.

 6 steps
 
•	User Interface
Create the user interface of the application using the provided css. Make sure buttons are used and they function correctly (e.g. a ‘Submit” button will submit the answer for evaluation).

•	Functionality
The application functions correctly, with answers properly marked as correct or incorrect. Make sure the questions do not repeat themselves until the question bank has been exhausted. Provided answers are reasonable based on the question asked.

•	Questions
Show which question the user is on (example: Question 2 of 10). Shuffle the questions so the quiz is in a different order each time the user takes the quiz. Shuffle the answers so that the correct answer is not in the same place each time.

•	Toasts
Use and display appropriate “toasts” for both correct and incorrect answers.

•	Final step
Show the final score.

•	Before you submit your project for review, make sure you can check off all of the items on the Student Project Submission Checklist. The checklist is designed to help you make sure you’ve met the grading requirements and that your project is complete and ready to be submitted!
